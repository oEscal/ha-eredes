A Home Assistant custom integration to fetch energy consumption data from [E-REDES](https://balcaodigital.e-redes.pt) (Portuguese electricity distribution network operator).

## Features

- Fetches 15-minute interval energy consumption data
- Imports up to 1 year of historical data
- Compatible with Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard
- Automatic re-authentication flow when token expires
- Multi-language support (English, Portuguese)

## Sensors

The integration creates one device per meter (`E-REDES Meter <CPE suffix>`) with two
entities. Entity IDs are derived from the device name, e.g. for a meter whose CPE ends
in `...MY`:

| Sensor | Example entity ID | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|------|
| Daily Energy | `sensor.e_redes_meter_my_daily_energy` | Total consumption for the most recent complete day. Because E-REDES publishes data with a ~24h delay, this reflects **yesterday's** total. | kWh |
| Power | `sensor.e_redes_meter_my_power` | Average power over the most recent 15-minute interval (derived from that interval's energy). | W |

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the three dots menu and select "Custom repositories"
3. Add `https://github.com/mrfyda/ha-eredes` with category "Integration"
4. Click "Install"
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Copy `custom_components/eredes` to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

This integration requires a session token from the E-REDES portal. Due to CAPTCHA protection on the login page, automatic authentication is not possible.

### Getting Your Token

1. Log into [balcaodigital.e-redes.pt](https://balcaodigital.e-redes.pt) in your browser
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to **Application** > **Cookies** > `https://balcaodigital.e-redes.pt`
4. Copy the value of the `aat` cookie

### Adding the Integration

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "E-REDES"
4. Enter your configuration:
   - **Access Token (aat)**: The value of the `aat` cookie from your browser (the full Cookie header is also accepted)
   - **CPE Code**: Your electricity meter CPE code (e.g., `PT0002000012345678AB`)

### Token Expiration

The token will expire after some time (typically when you log out or after extended inactivity). When this happens:

1. Home Assistant will show a re-authentication notification
2. Log into the E-REDES portal again
3. Copy the new `aat` cookie value
4. Enter it in the re-authentication form

## Energy Dashboard Setup

On first setup the integration imports up to a year of historical consumption into a
Home Assistant long-term statistic named **E-REDES Energy (`<CPE suffix>`)**
(id `eredes:energy_<cpe suffix>`). A full backfill is only marked complete when every
API chunk succeeds; failed runs write no partial history and are retried later. The
backfill format is versioned so upgrades can force a one-time repair of previously
incomplete history. On normal later restarts the integration resumes from the last
imported hour rather than re-importing the whole year. The same incremental history
synchronization runs on a configurable schedule so the Energy Dashboard statistic
remains current without requiring a restart or reload. The default is **every day at
05:00 in Home Assistant's local time**; both the time and frequency can be changed
from the integration's **Configure** options. Add that statistic to your Energy Dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Dashboards** > **Energy**
2. Under "Grid consumption", click **Add consumption**
3. Select **E-REDES Energy (`<CPE suffix>`)**

> The **Daily Energy** sensor is a live, at-a-glance entity for yesterday's total; the
> hourly history that feeds the Energy Dashboard is the `eredes:energy_…` statistic
> above.

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Manual token | Due to CAPTCHA, tokens must be obtained manually from browser |
| Token expiry | Token expires and requires periodic manual refresh |
| Data delay | E-REDES publishes consumption with roughly a 24h delay, so sensors reflect the previous day rather than real-time |
| Resolution | Data is provided in 15-minute intervals only |
| Real-time | For real-time monitoring, use a dedicated energy monitor (e.g., Shelly) |

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Token Error

If you see a token error:

1. Obtain a fresh token by logging into [balcaodigital.e-redes.pt](https://balcaodigital.e-redes.pt)
2. Copy the new `aat` cookie value
3. Reconfigure or re-authenticate the integration

### No Data

If sensors show "Unknown" or no data:

1. E-REDES publishes data with a ~24h delay, so the most recent full day may take up to a day to appear
2. Check the integration logs for errors
3. Verify your CPE code is correct
